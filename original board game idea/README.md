# Insanity

Description of the game:

Hi, welcome to Insanity the card game that will drive you insane because of how rediculous it can be. 
You play cards and fill up other people's insanity. 
Try not to go insane in the process :)

Supplies needed for the game:
*	Die/dice
*	Coins to keep tally or writing it down (keeping note of something).
*	Deck of cards.
*	2-6 players (must start the game with even number of players), someone can deal cards. Does not need a dedicated dealer.


# How to play:
*	The dealer will send out a pair of two cards to every player 
*	1 die is rolled by each player at the beginning of every round to determine duel order. 
    *   If die tie, players that tied roll again. 
*	Players decide who to duel against once the order has been set.
*	Players may only duel once per round. 
*	Once a duel is over the cards are sent to the discard pile.
*	A round is over when there are no more players to duel.
    *	If there is an odd number of players and someone does not participate in a duel. They must duel against the player with the lowest die roll in the next round.  
*	Each card has 2 values associated with it. A dueling value and an insanity value. 
*	The win condition of the game is to survive without going insane.
*	You lose the game by filling up your insanity meter, which has a capacity value of 10. Get 10 or more and you’re out of the game. 

*	Dueling value is the combined value of the cards:
    *	ace-10 Ace being the lowest value of 1.
    *	Face cards do not have number values, instead they have specials attributed to them.
        *	J: the player with a jack can swap the jack out with one of the cards from the person they are dueling essentially stealing their card.
        *	Q: the queen refuses to play games is asks the dealer to reveal the top 3 cards in the deck, picking a card of the 3 options to represent her in battle, the other 2 cards are shuffled back into the deck.
        *	K: draws an extra card from the deck and adds 1 cost to its insanity value.
    *	In the event that both players have face cards, they roll their die to determine who’s face card’s abilities activate first. (ability can only be used once by each unique card). 
    *	If you get a natural double ace you automatically win the round (free 6 cost to the face). 

*	Insanity value is given to each card as follows:
    *	Ace = 3 cost
    *	2-4 = 0 costs
    *	5-7 = 2 cost
    *	8-10= 1 cost
    *	J-K = 0 cost

*	The player that has a higher number total value wins the duel and gives the loser coins that represent insanity cost of the winning hand.  
    *	Cards that have been exhausted in a duel are placed into the discard pile until the dealer needs to re-shuffle. 
    *	Alternative to coins could just be keeping tally of your insanity meter.

*	If there is a tie, the players may make one of two decisions, they can either call it there and move on to next round or ask the dealer to continue flipping cards (one at a time) from the deck for each player until a winner is decided (up to a total of 3 additional cards maybe added using this method until all cards are discarded). 
    *	Can play rock-paper-scissors (or dice roll) in the event of disagreement (one player wants to flip and the other wants to skip).
