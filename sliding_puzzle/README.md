# Hello Pygame

This is an exercise to verify you have a working Python v.3 and Pygame installation to continue on to the next project in this course.

The requirements of this exercise are:

1. Create a [Python Virtual Environment](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/venv.html).
1. Install Pygame into the virtual environment using pip.
1. Copy [Al Sweigart's Slide Puzzle](https://github.com/asweigart/making-games-with-python-and-pygame/blob/master/slidepuzzle/slidepuzzle.py) into your repository.
1. Add Al Sweigart's Slide Puzzle to your repository and commit it.
1. Make any necessary changes to the `slidepuzzle.py` such that it can be run from the command prompt with the command `./slidepuzzle.py`. Verify that you are able to run `slidepuzzle.py`.
1. Freeze the virtual environment using the `pip freeze` command into a file named `requirements.txt`
1. Add `requirements.txt` to your repository and commit it.
1. Push your repository back to GitHub.

_Do not add and comit your Python virtual environment directory._
